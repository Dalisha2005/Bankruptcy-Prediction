# Bankruptcy-Prediction

This Jupyter Notebook is dedicated to forecasting bankruptcy using a range of machine learning techniques. The project encompasses data analysis, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and interpretation.

## Introduction

This notebook aims to forecast the probability of financial insolvency in companies by applying machine learning algorithms to financial data. The dataset includes 95 financial ratios from companies, used for bankruptcy prediction. Data were sourced from the Taiwan Economic Journal spanning the years 1999 to 2009.

## Methods Used

1. **Importing Libraries and Data**
2. **Checking Data Quality**
3. **Feature Engineering and Selection**
4. **Handling Class Imbalance**
5. **Model Building and Evaluation**
6. **Ensemble Modeling**

## Following Models were Employed

- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **XGBoost**
- **Voting Classifier to Ensemble the above models**

## Results

The ensemble classifier exhibited strong performance across various evaluation metrics, providing a comprehensive performance assessment.
